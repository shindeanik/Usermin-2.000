A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MIME type programs tab in Webmin-Usermin 2.000 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the handle program field while creating a new MIME type program.

In this observation the attacker added the malicious script as payload in the Handler program field while creating new MIME type program which results in the execution of the payload under MIME Type program page.
